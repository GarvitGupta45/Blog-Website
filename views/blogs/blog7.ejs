            <h2>This Christmas, learn how to find and share contagious joy with your friends, family, and neighbors in and around Newbreak Church.</h2>
            <p>I recently had the privilege of surprising both of my nephews at one of their weekday events. I was so excited to see them, and I got there early because I didn’t want to miss anything. As I waited in my car, my mind was going through all of the memories that I have with them and some of the funny things that they say. For instance, my nephew Joshua recently said, “The world would be a whole lot better if everyone thought like me.” Kids truly do say some of the funniest things.
                <br /><br />
                The time finally came, the wait was over, and both boys hopped out of the car and were so excited to see that I was there. The hugs, the laughs, and the walk to the event filled us all with enough joy to start an engine. Then the most beautiful moment happened. My nephew Johnny (12) is currently in Tae Kwon Do, and while he was practicing his moves, he would look over to see if I was still looking at him. Of course, I was, those boys are precious to me.
                <br /><br />
                It reminded me of how it must have felt for Mary, the mother of Jesus, when she was reminded that God looked at her. Mary, after she is told that she would be the Magnificent Mother of the Messiah, she breaks out into song. It was like High School Musical, but much better of course. She sings, “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, because he has looked with favor on the humble condition of his servant. Surely from now on all generations will call me blessed…”
                <br /><br />
                Mary magnifies God, she zooms in on all that God is and all that He has done, and then she shares why. Mary says, “Because He has looked with favor…” God sees you. God sees me. The same way that my eyes were locked in on my nephews as I saw them enjoying life, playing in the sand, and practicing Tae Kwon Do. God’s eyes are on you. He is not looking with anger or with frustration, God is looking with favor!</p>
                <br/><br/>
            
            <h2>That word favor means, "a demonstrated delight."</h2>
            <p>Think about that for a moment, the way that God looks at you is with a demonstrated delight. I can just imagine God looking at you with a smile as you drive the kids to school, pick them up, head to work, walk around the house, no matter where you are, God sees you. And the way He sees you and me, is the reason Mary broke out in song. Mary saw the delight of God because of who He is and who she belongs to.
                <br /><br />
                You belong to God and He looks at you with a demonstrated delight and a divine kindness! That should cause us to celebrate with Joy! So how do we rejoice?</p>
            <br/><br/>

            <h3>If God has done great things for you in the past, let’s start rejoicing in the present!</h3>
            <p>I heard about a church who gave everyone that walked into the building a red balloon. Thousands of people all were given a red balloon. The pastor walked up onto the platform and said, “If there is a moment in this service where you think of all that God has done for you and you want to celebrate and rejoice, let your balloon go and they will fill the room.” The service went on and began with worship, and boy did the balloons fly! The sermon begins and more balloons are let go! At the end of the service, the pastor looked around and saw that 1/3 of the people did not let go of their balloons. The pastor was moved to say, “God has done so many great things for us all, it is time you let go of your balloon, it is time to rejoice!”
                <br /><br />
                So for us today, what are the amazing things that God has done for us? Maybe it is time we let go of the balloon and celebrate with contagious joy!
